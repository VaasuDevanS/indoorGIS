    digraph SHPFiles {
       
          label="Updating the SHP files"
          
          "SHP files can be created / edited using ArcGIS / QGIS" ->
          "Updated SHP files has to be placed in 'static/HeadHall/SHPs' directory" ->
          "If new polygons are created (for any new rooms), unique PlaceNode has to be created" ->
          "Same PlaceNode has to be used in Places.SHP file"

   }
   
   

Extending for other buildings in UNB
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. graphviz::

    digraph ExtendingWork {
       
          label="Extending the work for other buildings"
          
          "Create new Django App using manage.py" ->
          "Create corresponding" ->
          {"model in models.py", "html page in templates/ directory", "python functions in views.py", "static files like images etc., in static/ directory"
        
        }

    }
   
The existing code can be used but variables / files must be changed
accordingly.
