Introduction
=============

Indoor Routing or Indoor searching of rooms, facilities, faculties has always
been one of the unsolved critical problems in GIS. There is no concrete and
complete framework available in any programming language to achieve this.
But there are many modules (packages / plugins) available which can be 
mixed and played around to form a solution. It us upto the choice the developer
to pock those modules and plugins for this task and this project indoorGIS
tries to solve this problem of searching and routing indoor with a methodology.
This is not the best novel approach to solve this but at the same time it is
not that time consuming or computationally expensive. It uses Geopandas_, 
Networkx_, Leaflet_, Jquery_ and it is hosted on pythonanywhere.com_ which is
free, easy-to-use web hosting platform for python based web applications.
