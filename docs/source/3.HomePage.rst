.. graphviz::

   digraph HomePage {
      "Request to indoorGIS.pythonanywhere.com" ->
      "Loading of StyleSheets, JS packages (Leaflet, etc.,)" ->
      "Loading of Base Maps and Carousels and other HTML elements" ->
      "Ajax function calls" -> {"loadFields \n(home.html)",
                                "loadJSON \n(home.html)",
                                "loadCategories \n(home.html)"
                                }
      "loadFields \n(home.html)" ->"loadFields \n(views.py)"
      "loadJSON \n(home.html)" -> "loadJSON \n(views.py)"
      "loadCategories \n(home.html)" -> "loadCategories \n(views.py)"
      
      {"loadFields \n(views.py)", "loadJSON \n(views.py)", "loadCategories \n(views.py)"} -> 
      "Users can now perform Searching / Routing"
   }


The above flow chart explains the things which will execute
when request is made to the web app (in chronological order).
Categories also follow the same workflow as seen in HomePage graph but it
is explained in this chapter in a detailed manner.
