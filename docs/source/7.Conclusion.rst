Conclusion
===========

This work demonstrates how with just putting two python modules and two
javascript modules together to solve the indoorGIS issue. For future works,
the main challenge is to prepare the data in such a way that this work can be
extended or used with little or less modifications. This project doesn't use
any Geodatabases like PostGIS_ or Spatialite_ because of the deployment 
platform limitations. However if the study area is more or if there are going
to be more concurrent users, this app can be extended to use those kind of
Geodatabases.
